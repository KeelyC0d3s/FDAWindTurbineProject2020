# FDAWindTurbineProject2020

In this project I had to perform and explain simple linear regression using Python
on the powerproduction dataset available on Moodle. 
The goal is to accurately predict wind turbine power output from wind speed values using the data set as a basis.
My submission had to be in the form of a git repository containing, at a minimum, the
following items:

* 1. Jupyter notebook that performs simple linear regression on the data set.
* 2. In that notebook, an explanation of your regression and an analysis of its accuracy.
* 3. Standard items in a git repository such as a README.

To enhance my submission, I compared simple linear regression to polynomial regression on this data set.



## How to Run the Jupyter Notebook:

1) Open the terminal on your Mac or PC
2) Navigate to the folder where your project is stored
3) Type Jupyter Notebook and press ‘Enter’
4) A browser will appear that will show a .ipynb document
5) Double-click on the .ipynb document and another tab will open with the Jupyter Notebook
6) Begin reading/working in your Jupyter Notebook
